# Additive rpath sweep for the PyInstaller onedir bundle.
#
# Usage: fix_rpaths.sh <dist-dir>
#
# PyInstaller's onedir bootloader sets LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the top-level
# _internal/ directory at process launch, so most bundled files resolve
# their siblings fine at runtime. But a bare `ldd <file>` (as OPStudio's
# deb-install CI check runs, and as the dynamic linker itself would for a
# direct dlopen()) never sees that env var, and some files genuinely need a
# baked-in path: e.g. a private vendored copy one level down in
# numpy.libs/scipy.libs/pillow.libs/, or a system lib generically collected
# into the top-level _internal/ dir but only reachable from a Qt plugin
# subdirectory like PySide6/Qt/plugins/imageformats/.
#
# This appends ($ORIGIN + a relative path back to _internal/, the directory
# PyInstaller's onedir COLLECT step puts every bundled file in other than the
# top-level launcher executable itself) to every ELF file's rpath.
# Deliberately uses --add-rpath, never --set-rpath/--remove-rpath: some files
# (e.g. the PySide6 imageformats plugins such as libqjpeg.so) already carry a
# correct, working rpath for their own direct deps, and clobbering it would
# trade one missing-library bug for another.
